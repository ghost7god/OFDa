# Mandatory Tutorial

Read the [#FAQ](README.md#faq) at the bottom of this page before submitting a issue.

## Running the app via docker

Build and run the image, mounting the appropriate directories:

`docker build -t only-fans . && docker run -it --rm --name onlyfans -v ${PWD}/.settings:/usr/src/app/.settings -v ${PWD}/.sites:/usr/src/app/.sites only-fans`

## Running the app locally

From the project folder open CMD/Terminal and run the command below:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Start:

`python start_ofd.py` or double click `start_ofd.py`

---

Open and edit:

`config.json`

[auth]

Fill in the following:

- `{"auth_id":"your_auth_id"}`
- `{"sess":"your_sess_token"}`
- `{"user-agent":"your_user-agent"}`

If you're using 2FA or have these cookies:

- `{"auth_hash":"your_auth_hash"}`
- `{"auth_uniq_":"your_auth_uniq_"}`

Optional change:

- `{"fp":"your_fp"}`
- `{"app-token":"your_token"}`

Only enter in cookies that reflect your OnlyFans account otherwise, you'll get auth errors.

Go to www.onlyfans.com and login, open the network debugger, then check the image below on how to get said above cookies
